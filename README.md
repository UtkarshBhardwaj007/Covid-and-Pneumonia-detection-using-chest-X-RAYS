# Covid-and-Pneumonia-detection-using-chest-X-RAYS

This project was done as a part of Artificial Intellingence course at Delhi Technological University.

Developed a minimalistic CNN architecture to detect healthy, covid infected and pneumonia infected people separately through their chest X-Ray Scans. Callbacks have been used to skip the need to hard code the number of iterations over the dataset. Other optimisations like image augmentation, cross validation, saving best weights have also been deployed. A demonstration video has been added to help understand the code.
